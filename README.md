# CustomItemSystem

A simple Spigot plugin for Minecraft 1.21.4 that adds a custom item ability system. Players can use `/addability <ability>` while holding an item to attach one of the built-in abilities. Using the item will trigger all attached abilities.

## Features

* Over twenty abilities with descriptions â€“ including custom powers like **Hyperion Beam** and **Terminator Volley**.
* Each ability has a mana cost. Players regenerate mana over time and the current amount is shown in the action bar.
* Items display each ability and its description in the lore.
* Improved slayer bosses with a boss bar showing kill progress and boss health.
* Simple `/armor` and `/ah` menus demonstrate custom armor and an auction house.

This project is a basic example and may require Spigot 1.20.1 API to compile.
