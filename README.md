# CustomItemSystem

A simple Spigot plugin for Minecraft 1.21.4 that adds a custom item ability system. Players can use `/addability <ability>` while holding an item to attach one of the built-in abilities. Using the item will trigger all attached abilities.

## Features

* Over twenty abilities with descriptions â€“ including new powers like **Frozen Scythe** and **Lightbinder**.
* Each ability has a mana cost. Players regenerate mana over time and the current amount is shown in the action bar.
* Items display each ability and its description in the lore.
* Improved slayer bosses with a boss bar showing kill progress and boss health.
* `/armor` opens a paged menu with ten themed armor sets from Hypixel and Wynncraft.
* `/ah` and `/ahsell` provide a basic but safer auction house where items can be listed and purchased.

This project is a basic example and may require Spigot 1.20.1 API to compile.
