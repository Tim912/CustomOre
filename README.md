# CustomItemSystem

A simple Spigot plugin for Minecraft 1.21.4 that adds a custom item ability system. Players can use `/addability <ability>` while holding an item to attach one of 20 built-in abilities. Using the item will trigger all attached abilities.

This project is a basic example and may require Spigot 1.20.1 API to compile.
